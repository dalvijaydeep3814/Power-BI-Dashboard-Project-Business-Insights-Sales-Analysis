- Identify **Top 5 Customers** with the most returns.  
- Identify **Top 5 Returned Products** with their return rates.  
- Find **minimum % of customers contributing to 50% of total profit** (Pareto Analysis).  
- Analyze **% of profitable orders by state** with maps.  
- Show **Top N Cities by Second-Class Shipments** (dynamic slicer-enabled).  
- Visualize **Monthly Sales Growth % by Region** for selected years.  
- Display **Quarterly Sales Trends** across multiple years.
